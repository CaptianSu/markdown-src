### The Amish
In the heart of America, in the states of pennsylvania, Ohio and indiana, live some people who are not your typical Americans. In order to lead simple lives, they don't use cars, Instead, they drive horse-drawn buggies. They don't use electric lights, either, not to mention telephones, They make their own clothing which looks ancient. And, to make matters worse, they don't speak English but German among themselves.

These people are the Amish. They settled in America almost 300 years ago. Most of them are farmers who stay away from the temptations of the city. As modern life becomes more and more complicated, the Amish way of life seems to make more and more sense.
